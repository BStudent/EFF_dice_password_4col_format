# EFF_dice_password_4col_format

The original diceware page is here: https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

The EFF has a somewhat improved approach to the same idea.

Word list for EFF diceware-style passwords, in 4 column pdf so that each page corresponds to the first two rolls - see https://www.eff.org/dice 

This is a word doc and pdf, both generated on a Mac that was scanned with Malwarebytes.  

## WARNING! IF YOU DOWNLOAD THESE DOCUMENTS YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK: 

### THESE WERE GENERATED ON COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE (MS WORD) AND OS (OSX) THAT I HAVE NEITHER THE TOOLS NOR SKILLS TO VERIFY.

Although my systems are up-to-date and I scanned the docs in this directory for malware prior to upload and did not detect any, that doesn't mean they do not contain malware.

By downloading these documents to your own computer or device, you assume all responsibility for the consequences of doing so, no matter how awful.

### How to "build from source"

If all that sounds too scary, you can try using your own copy of Word on the original EFF text file: I used four columns, Courier New font 9 Pts, and set the margins (US Letter) to 1.000" on right and left 1.125" on the bottom, and 1.250" for the top.

You could even go full freeto and try the above in Libre Office, which I was too lazy to do.
